description: Ingest a Claude Code, Codex, or T3 Code conversation by thread or session ID and continue it in the current chat. Use when the user asks to move, load, absorb, hand off, or pick up one specific agent session here.

# Move a session here

Turn one stored Claude Code or Codex transcript into working context for this
chat. Resolve a T3 Code thread to its provider transcript when needed. This is
an ingestion workflow. Read each source in place and leave it unchanged.

/move-session-here codex://threads/019a1111-2222-7333-8444-555555555555
/move-session-here t3://threads/11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111
```

Require exactly one Claude session ID, Codex thread deeplink, or T3 Code thread
deeplink. A bare ID means Claude. A `codex://threads/<id>` deeplink means Codex.
A `t3://threads/<id>` deeplink means T3 Code. Translate a natural-language
request that names a T3 Code thread ID to the T3 Code form.

## Extract the session

Resolve `<skill-directory>` to this skill's installed directory. Create two
temporary files, then run:

```sh
handoff_path="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/move-session-here.XXXXXX")"
handoff_error_path="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/move-session-here-error.XXXXXX")"
node <skill-directory>/scripts/session-handoff.mjs \
  '<session-reference>' >"$handoff_path" 2>"$handoff_error_path"
```

The helper enumerates directory-guarded config homes with `find`, including
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `~/.claude*`, and `~/.codex*`. It normalizes
the owning transcript and any Claude subagent sidecars into one JSON document.
It scopes Codex lookup to `sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`.

For a T3 Code reference, the helper reads `~/.t3/userdata/state.sqlite` through
a private snapshot and resolves its exact provider binding. Set `T3_STATE_DB`
to an absolute regular file to use one custom state database instead. The
helper does not scan other T3 stores. It keeps the T3 thread ID and database
path under `t3`; `format` and `sessionId` still identify the provider transcript.

On a nonzero exit, read the JSON error and stop:

- `not_found` means report the ID and every `searchedHomes` entry.
- `ambiguous_session` means report every match and ask for a unique source.
- `t3_store_not_found` or `t3_mapping_not_found` means report the T3 thread and
  database path.
- `t3_stale_binding` means the mapped provider transcript is missing.
- `t3_mapping_ambiguous` or `t3_ambiguous_binding` means report the identifying
  details and ask for one unambiguous source.
- Any other error means report its code and identifying details.

The helper's result owns session identity. Do not replace it with substring
search or pick a transcript that merely mentions the ID. Treat a Claude
`bridgeSessionId` as provenance only. Native bridge and resume mechanisms do
not provide a cross-agent handoff.

## Build the continuation brief

Read the normalized document through the final event of every track. Process a
large document in chronological chunks and carry one cumulative brief forward;
skip no chunk. Tool calls show intent, while tool outputs and later messages
show what happened. Prefer the later evidence when they disagree.

Build one private continuation brief with all of these fields:

- Source format, provider session ID, transcript paths, cwd, branch, and model.
- T3 Code thread ID and database path when the result contains `t3`.
- The user's goal and explicit constraints.
- Decisions already made and their recorded rationale.
- Files and other artifacts read, changed, created, or proposed, with their
  last known state.
- Commands, tests, and external operations already run, with outcomes.
- Failed approaches, unresolved risks, blockers, and open questions.
- Active skills, plugins, MCP tools, and subagent findings that affect the work.
- The last completed step and the single next action.

Separate transcript facts from your inferences. Resolve contradictions in favor
of the latest direct result. Replace credentials and other secrets with
`[redacted]` in anything you show or persist.

## Reconcile live state and continue

Inspect the current cwd, branch, worktree status, and every artifact needed for
the next action. The transcript is historical evidence, not current state. Name
any mismatch in the brief and follow the repository's workflow before changing
branches or files.

Tell the user the recovered goal, current state, and next action in a short
capsule. Then continue from that action without asking the user to restate the
session. Stop only for a real permission, product-decision, or safety boundary.

Remove the two temporary files after the brief is established. Leave the T3
state database, its sidecars, and every source transcript in place. Write only
the derived temporary artifact, and continue without a native resume command.
