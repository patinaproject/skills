# Fix CI

## Trigger

Branch or PR CI is failing and needs a fast, iterative path to green checks.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the active PR and inspect `gh pr checks --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link`.
2. Inspect failed jobs and extract the first actionable error. Use GitHub Actions logs when available; otherwise use the check link to identify the failing command or service.
3. Before each edit and each push, follow [Repair from evidence](../patina-mode/SKILL.md#repair-from-evidence).
4. Apply the one focused fix that the diagnosis supports.
5. Push, wait for the current head's checks to finish, and repeat while the next fix has evidence.

## Guardrails

- Fix one actionable failure at a time.
- Prefer minimal, low-risk changes before broader refactors.
- Keep `gh pr checks` as the source of truth for overall PR CI state.

## Output

- Primary failing job and root error
- Fixes applied in iteration order
- Current CI status and next action
- Missing evidence, when you stop before green
