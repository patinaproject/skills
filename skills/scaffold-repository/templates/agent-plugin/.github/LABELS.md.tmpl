# Labels

This file is the source of truth for when to apply each issue and pull-request label in this repository. It exists so reporters and agents can pick labels without guessing, and so label drift stays visible in review. For the authoritative runtime inventory, run `gh label list --json name,description`.

## Labels

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bug` | Apply when the report describes a defect, regression, or unexpected behavior in shipped code or docs. |
| `documentation` | Apply when the change is primarily to Markdown, in-repo docs, or comments that describe behavior. |
| `duplicate` | Apply when another open or closed issue already tracks the same problem; link the canonical issue in the body. |
| `enhancement` | Apply when the report proposes a new capability or improves an existing one without fixing a defect. |
| `good first issue` | Apply when the work is small, well-scoped, and safe for a first-time contributor to pick up. |
| `help wanted` | Apply when maintainers are actively soliciting outside contributions on the issue. |
| `invalid` | Apply when the report is not actionable as filed (wrong repo, not reproducible, out of scope) and cannot be salvaged by editing. |
| `question` | Apply when the issue is a support request or clarification rather than a change request. |
| `wontfix` | Apply when the behavior described is intentional or the maintainers have decided not to act on it; leave a short rationale before closing. |

### Release-please (tool-managed)

`release-please` creates and applies these labels automatically on the standing release PR; do not apply or remove them by hand. They may not appear in `gh label list` until the first release cycle runs.

- `autorelease: pending`: Applied to the release PR while a release is in progress.
- `autorelease: tagged`: Applied to the release PR once the release has been tagged.

## Adding or changing labels

Use `gh label list --json name,description` as the canonical inventory and follow the label-hygiene rule in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (every label must have a non-empty description). Do not introduce new labels in an issue or PR without first updating the repository label set and this file.
